# - We toss a normal coin two times. Find the sample space of this experiment and assign it to the list coin_toss_omega.
#   - One of the outcomes is heads first, tails second. Abbreviate heads as H, tails as T, and assign the string 'HT'
#     (heads first, tails second) to the list coin_toss_omega. Repeat this pattern for the other outcomes.
