# - A fair six-sided die is rolled twice and the following three events are considered:
#   - Event K — the die showed a 4 on the second roll
#   - Event L — the die showed a 2 on the first roll
#   - Event M — the die showed an even number on the second roll
# - Find whether the following events are independent or not:
#   -  Events K and L — assign the string 'independent' to a variable named k_and_l if the events are independent,
#      otherwise assign the string 'dependent'.
#   -  Events L and M — assign the string 'independent' to a variable named l_and_m if the events are independent,
#      otherwise assign the string 'dependent'.
#   - Events K and M — assign the string 'independent' to a variable named k_and_m if the events are independent,
#     otherwise assign the string 'dependent'.
