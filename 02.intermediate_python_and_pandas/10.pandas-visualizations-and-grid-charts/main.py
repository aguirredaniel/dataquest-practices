# - Import matplotlib.pyplot, and plot a histogram for the Slowness in traffic (%) column â€” run your code without
#   submitting the answer.
# - Based on the histogram, evaluate the truth value of the sentences below.
#   - The distribution of Slowness in traffic (%) is right skewed. Assign the Boolean True or False to sentence_1.
#   - Most of the values pile up on the left side of the histogram. Assign True or False to sentence_2.
#   - Most of the values are over 15.0%. Assign True or False to sentence_3.
