# - What is the unit length of the x-axis? Assign your answer to x_unit_length.
# - What is the unit length of the y-axis? Assign your answer to y_unit_length.
# - What is x-coordinate of point A? Assign your answer to x_coordinate_A.
# - What is the y-coordinate of point B? Assign your answer to y_coordinate_B.
# - What are the x- and y-coordinates of point C? Assign your answer as a Python list to C_coordinates â€” the
