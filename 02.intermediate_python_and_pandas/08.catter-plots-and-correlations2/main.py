# - Generate a scatter plot with the atemp column (feeling temperature) on the x-axis and the registered column on the
#   y-axis.
# - Run your code without submitting the answer. Inspect the resulting scatter plot.
# - What type of correlation do you see between the atemp and registered columns? Assign your answer to the variable
#   correlation â€” choose between the strings 'positive', 'negative', and 'no correlation'.
