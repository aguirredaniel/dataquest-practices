# - Consider the following sets:

#   - N = {22, car insurance, 2, house insurance}
#   - O = {HHHH, TTTT, TH}
#   - P = {Hockey, Cycling, Athletics, Swimming}
# - Consider the following set operations and their results:
#   - M ∪ P = Ø: If you think the result is correct, assign the boolean True to a variable named operation_1, otherwise
#     assign False.
#   - N ∩ M = {22, 2}: If you think the result is correct, assign the boolean True to a variable named operation_2,
#     otherwise assign False.
#   - O ∪ M = {HHHH, TTTT, 100, 22, 2}: If you think the result is correct, assign the boolean True to a variable named
#     operation_3, otherwise assign False.
#   - P ∩ N = Ø: If you think the result is correct, assign the boolean True to a variable named operation_4, otherwise
