# - Generate a kernel density plot for the SalePrice variable to find out how far off $220,000 is from the mean.
#
# Generate the plot using Series.plot.kde().
# The limits of the x-axis should be the minimum and the maximum value of the SalePrice variable. To set the limits you can use the xlim parameter of Series.plot.kde().
# Plot a vertical line to indicate visually the location of the mean using plt.axvline().
# The color of the line should be black, and its label should be 'Mean'. You can use the color and label parameters of plt.axvline().
# Plot a vertical line to indicate visually the standard deviation distance above the mean â€” you'll have to generate a vertical line for the sum of the mean and standard deviation.
# Assume that the data is a population and compute the standard deviation without using Bessel's correction.
# The color of the line should be red and its label should be 'Standard deviation'.
# Plot a vertical line for the $220,000 price.
# The color of the line should be orange and its label should be '220000'.
# Display all the labels using plt.legend().
# Examine the graph and figure out whether a price of $220,000 is very expensive. If it's very expensive, assign True to variable named very_expensive, otherwise assign False.
