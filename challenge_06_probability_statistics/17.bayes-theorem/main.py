# - For the exercises below, consider the following probabilities:
#   - The probability of being infected with HIV is 0.00014. That is P ( H I V ) = 0.00014 .
#   - The probability of being infected with HIV given a positive result from an HIV test is 0.03.
# - Assess with True or False the following statements:
#   - Events HIV and T+ are independent. If you think this statement is true, then assign the boolean True to
#     statement_1, otherwise assign False. Events HIV and HIVC are mutually exclusive.
#   - If you think this statement is true, then assign the boolean True to statement_2, otherwise assign False.
#   - Events HIVC and T+ are dependent. If you think this statement is true, then assign the boolean True to
#     statement_3, otherwise assign False.
