# - Read in the winequality-white.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.
#   - Use sep=';' to properly read the file.
#   - Assign the result to white_wine.
# - Calculate the correlation between quality and the other columns of white_wine.
#   - The result should be a pandas Series with the same structure as the Series resulted from
#     red_wine.corr()['quality'][:-1].
#   - Assign the correlation values to white_corr.
# - Examine the correlation values â€” what are the strongest two correlations? How does this compare to the red wine
#   values?
