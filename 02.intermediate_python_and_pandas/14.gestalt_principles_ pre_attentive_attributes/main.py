# Examine the FiveThirtyEight graph, and evaluate the truth value of the following sentences.
# - The principle of proximity creates three main sections: the title and the subtitle section, the bar chart section,
#   and the sources section. If you think this is true, assign the Boolean True to sentence_1; otherwise, assign False.
# - The principle of proximity inside the bar chart creates two visually distinct sections: total mail (first section)
#   and shipping and packaging (second section). If you think this is true, assign True to sentence_2; otherwise, assign
#   False.
# - The visualization is not a data story because there's no element of change. If you think this is true, assign True
#   to sentence_3; otherwise, assign False.
