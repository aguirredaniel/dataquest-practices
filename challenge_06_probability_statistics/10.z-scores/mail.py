# - Standardize the distributions of the index_1 and index_2 variables. We've coded these columns under the hood, and
#   they're already part of the houses data set.
#  - Assume that the values we have for both variables constitute populations.
#  - Don't forget that each distribution has its own mean and standard deviation.
# - Print the z-scores for the first two houses in the data set to find out which house has a better overall quality.
#   - Assign your answer as a string to a variable named better â€” if the first house is better, assign 'first',
#     otherwise assign 'second'.
