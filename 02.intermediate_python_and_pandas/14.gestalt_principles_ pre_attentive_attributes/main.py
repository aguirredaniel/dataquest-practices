# Evaluate the truth value of the following sentences.

# - Based on similarity of shape, we see two different groups: people who rarely or never vote and people who sometimes
#   vote. If you think this is true, assign the Boolean True to sentence_1; otherwise, assign False.
# - Proximity divides the graph area into nine different bar charts. Assign True or False to sentence_2.
# - This isn't a data story because it doesn't show a sequence of events, nor does it show any element of change. Assign
#   True or False to sentence_3.
