# Evaluate the truth value of the following sentences.

# - The principle of connection shows that the y-axis is the same for both bar plots. If you think this is true,
#   assign the Boolean True to sentence_1; otherwise, assign False.
# - Two curved arrows link two snippets of text to two nearby bars â€” this is an application of the principle of
#    proximity. Assign True or False to sentence_2.
